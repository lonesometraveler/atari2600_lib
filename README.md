# Atari 2600 lib

This is an Atari 2600 emulator library in progress.

Derived from the [atari2600](https://github.com/ltriant/atari2600) project, which is a bin project, I extracted the core functionalities to create this lib crate. The decision to develop it as a library is motivated by the intention to execute it on various platforms. In addition to running as a desktop app, I envision running an emulator on Raspberry Pi and outputting video to LED displays.
